# SecurityTraining
======

Course structure
-----

This is a self-training course on web application (including mobile) security, designed for use at Scott Logic. It's organised around the concept of quite specific attacks, presenting each attack as a single short module, so you can dip in and out, learning in bite-sized chunks.

The focus of the course is about security concerns when building web applications, which is what we do. It's not about penetration testing in general.

**Important**. In order to defend your apps against attacks you will need to learn how to run those attacks. Just because you can, does not mean you should go straight out and start hacking the world. Never do this stuff on live systems (including our own) or without the owner's consent, and don't inadvertently weaken the security of your own machine. 

The target audience for this course is:
* Testers
* Developers
* Architects 
* PMs and anyone else involved in web app development

The purpose of the course is to raise everyone's awareness and knowledge of these issues. I believe this is more important than having a few people who know a lot about the subject (and I wouldn't put myself in that category). I absolutely welcome corrections, additions, suggestions and new resources (especially in the form of pull requests to this repo). I also recommend that you watch this repo to be notified of new commits.

Each attack is described in a Markdown file under the Attacks folder. It will consist of a description of the attack, how to run it by hand, links to automated tools, exercises and resources etc. The key to the training is DO THE EXERCISES. The concepts are not difficult here, it's the necessary attitude that is important in this area. You need to be thinking about people deliberately trying to break your app in very creative ways, and hands-on experience of doing it is a great way of getting into this mindset.

Some exercises invite developers (only) to fix the code. The course will not give coded solutions (hints, suggestions and hand-wavy how-tos for the given tech stack at best), and any fix on the sample code is going to be specific to the technology used on the sample app. So you can either take a local branch and fix on that (see below) or alternatively, build something yourself in the tech of your choice, and fiddle with that.

The vulnerable sample apps will be implementations of a simple (and not at all polished) social media app. They will all have the same UI and functionality, but will use different architecture. They are hosted in VMs (see below), but can be run from your desktop (see the individual samples for URLs). New features will be added to the samples to support new attack modules. The samples are *horribly* insecure and you will see many bad practices throughout. Try to concentrate on the specific attack under discussion. ;-) .

Currently we have two sample apps

* MEAN_stack. A modern-style SPA using Mongo / Express / Angular / Node
* Jade\_Express\_MySQL. A more traditional app with server-generated HTML and a SQL database

Currently we have three attack modules

* Session hijacking via MITM
* SQL (and other) injection attacks
* Cross site scripting

Dev/test environment setup
-----

The sample vulnerable apps and other utilities run in VMs on your local machine, set up with Vagrant.
So you'll need to install VirtualBox (you will need the latest version if you have windows 10) and Vagrant.
See [https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html) if you haven't used Vagrant before.

After installing Vagrant you will need to update the vagrant home as the default is in your user directory and will immediately take you over your allowed profile storage space when it downloads the Ubuntu files.
This can be done by going to edit environment variables from control panel and adding a new variable VAGRANT_HOME and setting it to the file location you want to use.

The sample apps are node apps running on an ubuntu 14.04 VM. In these VMs the /vagrant directory is mapped to the project folder of the  The samples are run by a gulp task which watches the source files. Editing and saving source will trigger gulp task to build and restart the server, so no IDE build is required. So branching and modifying the code should also 'just work', fingers crossed.

**Important.** When the vagrant file is created it installs (and where necessary builds) node packages on the (ubuntu) VM. If you run npm install on your local Windows machine it will almost certainly break your VM and you will need to recreate it. Attempting to run the samples on both the VM and locally will end in tears of rage and frustration - it's an interesting problem in itself, but has nothing to do with this course.


Running samples
-----

To run any of the samples, you navigate to the project folder. There will be a vagrantfile there, and you can start the VM with:

	vagrant up

**You must run this in an administrator command prompt on Windows**, otherwise the VM will not be able to create symlinks.

N.B. This will take quite a while the first time you start a VM, especially the first time

When you're done (temporarily), halt it with:

	vagrant halt
	
Next time you start it will be faster to load. Or take it down completely with:

	vagrant destroy

(you may also need to remove it with Virtual box manager). 
And if you need to get medieval

	vagrant ssh


The social media samples start with an empty database. Navigate to Register, and create a new user. Then you can add posts. Currently it is not persisting sessions on the client side, so if you refresh, you'll need to log in again.


Running samples on a zero client machine
-----

Since the zero client machines are connecting to a VM you will struggle to start another VM within it. The short term workaround for this is to run the sample locally. This will require the following steps:

* Install MongoDB from https://www.mongodb.org/downloads#production
* Create a folder for the MongoDB data directory. The default location is c:\data\db but another location can be specified at startup.
* Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/
* Install Gulp

	npm install -g gulp
	
* Change the port in config.js (e.g. to 3000)
* Navigate to the directory of the sample and run:

	npm install
	
* Start MongoDB by navigating to the bin directory where you installed MongoDB and running:

	mongod.exe
	
Or if you created the data directory in a different location you need to specify it as an argument:
	
	mongod.exe --dbpath "c:\data\db"
	
* Start server by running the following in the directory of the sample:

	gulp dev
	
* When the server starts up you should be able to connect to localhost on the port specified in the config.js.
